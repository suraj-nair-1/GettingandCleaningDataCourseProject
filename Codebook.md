# Codebook for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## This Codebook describes the variables and layout of the data produced by the run_analysis.R file. Details regarding the exact steps taken to create this dataset can be found in the ReadMe and in the comments in the run_analysis.R file itself.

### Layout:
* The dataset is a data frame consisting of 180 rows and 68 columns. 
* Each row is an observation and each column is a variable.
* Specifically, each row represents a single activity for a single subject, and the values for each of the follwing variables correspond to the average value of that variable for that subject performing that activity. 
* Thus, there are 180 observations for the 30 subjects, each having 6 activities. 
* Not including the columns for subject and activity, there are 66 other columns pertaining to the averages of specific measurements

### Variables: 
* The first two columns correspond to the subject and activity for which the rest of the measurements correspond
* The following list contains all of the variables for each observation:
  +"tBodyAcc-mean()-X"          
  +"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"           
  + "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
